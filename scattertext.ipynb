Tales of other relatives that had done some strange or suspicious things, thing such as one's husband mysteriously dying or fishing trips that didn't include fishing. I'd never heard most of this because my mother has a bad memory.\r\n",

Each wall held a time on it symbolizing the start and stop time of the bombing, 9:01 and 9:03. Then to represent those lost gold chairs where placed in a roped of field, mini chairs were used to distinguish the lost adults from the children. It was sad to imagine that the number of chairs could hold the number of people gone in a split second.The next week I spend hanging around doing nothing. Then the last week of my visit my oldest sister Courtney flew up to spend a week with us then take me home. With her there it was even more fun. The three of us would talk all day about things. Then finally the trip was over, Courtney and I got on a plan home. Which went over just fine until the lay over in Dallas. The weather was bad that day and the screen told us our flight was cancelled. So we exited the airport to get another ticket. Yet when we finally got to the counter the lady told us it wasn't cancelled, that they had made a mistake with the monitors. So that was a relief except that the plane was about to leave and we had to go back through security. After all that we finally got on the plane just in time. That's how I spent half of my summer vacation.\n",
      "We went to my cousinas wedding. It was a lovely wedding very unlike any wedding Iave yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashersa| never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they werenat invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousinas face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  Heas still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  Iave been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasnat there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You may recall that the groomas parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didnt go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But all of my aunts and uncles went, and I have a lot of aunts and uncles. It was funny to see all my uncles and my cousin and the characteristic ears of that side of the family.  The family resemblance is especially strong with military haircuts.  All my uncles are ex-military and they bonded with my cousinas army buddies.  Not much has changed in the army in the past 30-40 years.  SNAFUs still abound.  My aunts talked about how the world has changed and wondered if the homophobic father of the groom realized his favorite aunt (after whom one of his daughters is named) was a lesbian.  How nice it would have been if shead been around today and been able to share her relationship with her acompaniona out in the open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They openly wondered what had happened to my unclea head always been rigid and never had a sense of humor, but wasnat such a hater until he married his wife.  Perhaps he could have been rigid and humorless for the powers of good if head married someone else.  Ironically, the woman he married and is refusing to countenance this wedding is a divorced mother of three| but the difference is that she got the Pope to annul that marriage, so somehow that made it ok.  There was some speculation that perhaps the bride is better off with her mother-in-law not talking to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My childless aunt and uncle took over duties of parents of the groom. The groom gave an especially moving speech about how grateful he was for his family to come and show the support they were showing.  The bride sent a lovely thank-you note with the same sentiments.  As the wedding party was breaking up for the folks having to catch planes, the bride and groom made plans to visit all of my aunts and uncles who live in interesting and accessible places.  My family does take care of its own, even when some members refuse to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My cousin and his new wife are very nice people.  I know they will have a lifetime of happiness together.  And if their children and step-children are close with their great-aunts and uncles rather than their grandparents on my side of the family, well, that's not such a bad thing.\n",

This was an event that I still recall vividly. I was then only 7-8 years old and when I saw a little angel was crying on my mother's lap, I became the happiest man in the world. I was the only son of my parents and when I heard that I will have another sibling, I got very excited and I was counting days when this brother/ sister of mine will come.

My mother gave birth of the baby in a hospital and I was so happy and attached to the event that I denied returning home at night.

It was one of our first real exclusive mother and daughter trips since an unhappy incident that shook our family life. I have always had a love for music so one night, my mother decided to take me out to visit the stretch of reggae,grunge and EDM pubs and open air cafes and clubs around where she was working. We got all girly with some mascara and lipstick,hair loose,and wearing skirts and sequins. We went to a reggae cafe where I fell absolutely in love with the whole place. The resident guitarist sang a few songs for us, 'November Rain,Songs of Freedom',About A Girl,Last Kiss,Wish You Were Here,and House of The Rising Sun. It was all so lovely: the people,the atmosphere,the smoke,the music,the sound of the busy street blending in with the melody from the guitar,the songs and the messages contained in it.It was euphoric. \r",

There were tales of runaway cows, gardening attempts, going to school in the cold winter and throwing up on long bus journeys down from the hills. Munnar always seemed like a little piece of heaven to me. Around the time my father went away to college, my grandfather relocated to our hometown of Kottayam following his retirement. My father didnt return for more than thirty years in fear of tainting his cherished memories. He finally gave in when the rest of his siblings planned a trip to see if their old house, school and other favorite places were still there.\r\n",

But my father insists that it was much better sixty years ago when the British company Messrs Finlay Muir & Co ran the town. The town had grown due to the tea estates owned by Finlay Muir in the name of Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company. From electricity generation to hospitals, everything was set up and managed by the company but he remembers it to be an extremely well-run town. Even the roads were washed down everyday, he says. The company also ran the school where my granddad was the Headmaster and that my father attended. He recalls the Munnar Supply Association (MSA) being a shop for the British with many imported things that seemed exotic to him like cheese and preserves. We went in to take a look on that trip but there was nothing remotely exotic in there.\r\n",

We stayed at one of our favourite homestays in Munnar, Casa del Fauno and were lucky that we caught both the glorious sunset and sunrise over a steep valley. My father looked so content and happy to be back in Munnar. The next day we visited another of our hotels in Munnar, Windermere Estate. The manager mentioned that the great grandson of James Finlay had stayed with them a while ago. So we were not the only people who were making nostalgic trips to Munnar :) If you look at these pictures, it will be clear why I am a wee bit sentimental about the place too.\n",

      "Itas a trip to Kanyakumari from Bangalore. Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of mainland India and is surrounded by three water bodies. Bay of Bengal towards east, Indian Ocean in south and Arabian Sea in west. I think it is the only place to see sun rise and sun set in water bodies in India. Kanyakumari town is named after the goddess Kanyakumari amman, a popular deity of the area. Legend has it that the goddess Parvathi in one of her incarnation as devi Kanya did penance on one of the rock of this landas end to obtain the hand of lord Siva. Tip of the day a Never ever wear any footwear which is difficult to open in Kanyakumari like sneakers or other shoes. Every place you visit, you have to open your shoe even in museum. 2nd tip of the day a Always wear socks to protect your feet from heat. 3rd tip a Protect yourself with best sunscreen lotion you have. 4th one a everybody speaks Hindi. 5th one a Hardly any non veg restaurant. Everyone is veg and I figured out only one non veg which became my favorite. Ok ok lots of free trip.\r\n",

There lots of local public bus very frequent to go to Kanyakumari. But then I came to know that it will take 2 hours to reach in this type of bus because it will go everywhere and will stop in every place. One person told us that if we walk a kilometer from there to reach highway, then we will get direct express bus for Kanyakumari and will take hardly 20 min to reach. Along with us there were another family who came to highway road bus stop. After waiting for 10 min, a bus came and we boarded that bus. Ticket was Rs. 18 per head and we reached Kanyakumari around 3:30 pm. We asked one fellow passenger to drop us in Kanyakumari Railway station. I had a printed google map of all the places from Kanyakumari Railway station. Anyway we got down and saw that itas the entrance for Our Lady of Ransom Church.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We decided to go to the church and then search for hotel. We did that promptly. Itas a beautiful church. A bit of information about this church a Located on the shoreline of the Bay of Bengal, the 100 year old Church in dedicated to Mother Mary. It was built in the Gothic style of architecture with a strong Portuguese influence. It is 153 feet high and is crowned with a cross of pure gold. One lady near the entrance asked me if I know Tamil and I replied yes. May be she knows only Tamil and wanted to communicate something important. She told me that behind the church, there is a staircase and on top there is a new smaller church build and we also get to see beautiful view of Bay of Bengal from the terrace. We opened our shoe and went inside the church. Interior was very simple just opposite to the decoration on outside. Then we went backstage and went to that new church which was pretty small and from the terrace we can see the beautiful sea. We could not take any picture because we did not yet open our luggage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next was our hotel search. Tell you something, if there are 100 houses for local resident, then there are 1000 hotels for tourist. So we decided to go near the beach and get a hotel. In the midway we found a budget Hotel Sangam. We wanted to enquire the rate and they told Rs. 1300 and 1000 for A/C and Non A/C double bed. We told its too much and we were about to leave and the receptionist told us, that they have room for Rs 600. Basically itas the same room and since it is off season, they lower the rate and I instantly booked it for 3 days. After refreshing we went to the restaurant downstairs. We did not wanted something fancy so ordered for 2 plates of lunch meal. Tell you something, I donat know what they gave in food but I till late night I was not hungry. So we decided that we are not going to go in that restaurant anymore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We headed toward Triveny Sangam (which is the meeting point of three water bodies). I am confused here. Till now I know that there are 3 different Triveny Sangam (one near Srirangapatnam, another near Coorg and next is this one). If a traveler ask for Triveny Sangam details, where will the person refer to? Anyway itas a rocky place and no sea beach as such. There are plenty of shops for sea shells and they are pretty cheap AMO. Big shells were for Rs. 200 whereas in Chennai they are sold for min Rs. 500 for bad quality ones. We can have a so-so view for sun rise and sun set from here with lots of obstacles. After the sun set and few photographs, we left the place.\n",
      "We went to my cousinas wedding. It was a lovely wedding very unlike any wedding Iave yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashersa| never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they werenat invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousinas face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  Heas still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  Iave been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasnat there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You may recall that the groomas parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didnt go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But all of my aunts and uncles went, and I have a lot of aunts and uncles. It was funny to see all my uncles and my cousin and the characteristic ears of that side of the family.  The family resemblance is especially strong with military haircuts.  All my uncles are ex-military and they bonded with my cousinas army buddies.  Not much has changed in the army in the past 30-40 years.  SNAFUs still abound.  My aunts talked about how the world has changed and wondered if the homophobic father of the groom realized his favorite aunt (after whom one of his daughters is named) was a lesbian.  How nice it would have been if shead been around today and been able to share her relationship with her acompaniona out in the open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They openly wondered what had happened to my unclea head always been rigid and never had a sense of humor, but wasnat such a hater until he married his wife.  Perhaps he could have been rigid and humorless for the powers of good if head married someone else.  Ironically, the woman he married and is refusing to countenance this wedding is a divorced mother of three| but the difference is that she got the Pope to annul that marriage, so somehow that made it ok.  There was some speculation that perhaps the bride is better off with her mother-in-law not talking to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My childless aunt and uncle took over duties of parents of the groom. The groom gave an especially moving speech about how grateful he was for his family to come and show the support they were showing.  The bride sent a lovely thank-you note with the same sentiments.  As the wedding party was breaking up for the folks having to catch planes, the bride and groom made plans to visit all of my aunts and uncles who live in interesting and accessible places.  My family does take care of its own, even when some members refuse to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My cousin and his new wife are very nice people.  I know they will have a lifetime of happiness together.  And if their children and step-children are close with their great-aunts and uncles rather than their grandparents on my side of the family, well, that's not such a bad thing.\n",

I have always had a love for music so one night, my mother decided to take me out to visit the stretch of reggae,grunge and EDM pubs and open air cafes and clubs around where she was working. We got all girly with some mascara and lipstick,hair loose,and wearing skirts and sequins. We went to a reggae cafe where I fell absolutely in love with the whole place. The resident guitarist sang a few songs for us, 'November Rain,Songs of Freedom',About A Girl,Last Kiss,Wish You Were Here,and House of The Rising Sun.

      "text       Summer vacation. It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We reached Mettupalayam by train. From there we took another train for Wellington. This journey, in the little mountain railway, was quite exhilarating and unforgettable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the journey we saw breath-taking scenes of Nigeria hills and forests. There were my maternal uncle, aunt, their little daughter Jasmine and 2 attendants to receive us at the station. We were overAjoyed to see and meet one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day, and then on the week-end, we visited Ooty. On both these visits we enjoyed the beauty, freshness, food walking, horse-riding and excursions. Situated at the height of 2,286 meters on Nigeria hills, Ooty is a very popular and famous hill resort of South India. It is in the state of Tamil Nadu. Full of rich tourist- activities and possibilities round the year, Ooty was discovered in 1819 by the then collector of Combater, an Englishman, Mr. John Sullivan. He constructed his summer residence there. He was the first man to do so. He was soon followed by numerous other Englishmen. It then became the summer seat of Provincial Government of Madras.\\r\\nThe temperate coolness attracts a large crowd of people from nearby areas, provinces and distant parts of the country. Originally it belonged to the Toads, a hill tribe which still lives in the Nigeria Hills. This aQueen of the Hill Stationsa is full of nice outdoor activities like hiking, boating, fishing, horse-riding, long walks, excursions and shopping. There is a big and wonderful botanical garden in the very heart of the town. It has more than 600 varieties of exotic plants and trees. We visited the botanical garden and then enjoyed boating in the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to Deadbeats Peak in our uncle's car. From there we had an excellent panoramic view of the plains below. Is the highest point and boasts the height of 2,638 meters. There is also a telescope for the viewing pleasure of the tourists. We also visited and immensely enjoyed the nearby Samas Park, a nice picnic spot full of many varieties of plants, trees, herbs and a fine pool full of lilies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopping in the small but colorful market of the town is an unforgettable experience. Mother bought a few silk sarisa, spices and some other items as gifts for our friends and relations. I bought some special tea and items of woodcraft. Ooty, overlooking blue hills and lush green valleys, is a very pleasant place and tourist resort. There was a big crowd of Indian and foreign tourists.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also visited nearby Connor, a small but colorful town amidst sprawling tea gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this still station. We also exposed a number of films to capture beautiful and natural scenes, events and memorable moments. These photographs will help us to keep our joy and memories of the place ever new and fresh.\n",

      "text       I like traveling. Iam very thankful to god because giving me a family that loves to travel. When I go for traveling with my family, there are a lot of interesting place that we visit. Between traveling at bigger city and go traveling at Island, I will choose the Island to travel. I donat like travel at bigger city because it was so noisy and a lot of pollution. Enough for me to live and always trapped in the traffic jam especially when Iam go back home to my own town Johor Bharu. My parent will take us to go for traveling especially when school holiday is coming. A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven o'clock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o'clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. Iam the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort. Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island. \\r\\n\\r\\n\n",

      "text       I like traveling. Iam very thankful to god because giving me a family that loves to travel. When I go for traveling with my family, there are a lot of interesting place that we visit. Between traveling at bigger city and go traveling at Island, I will choose the Island to travel. I donat like travel at bigger city because it was so noisy and a lot of pollution. Enough for me to live and always trapped in the traffic jam especially when Iam go back home to my own town Johor Bharu. My parent will take us to go for traveling especially when school holiday is coming. A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven o'clock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o'clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. Iam the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort. Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island. \\r\\n\\r\\n\n",

      "text       We all love to go for picnics during our holidays, especially in the winter season. A picnic brings about excitement, exhilaration and breaks the monotony in our lives. I also had gone for a picnic with my family and relatives, the memories of which I will always cherish. We decided to go for a picnic on the 1st of march, which also coincided with the New Year celebrations. I remember how excited I was and so was my younger brother and cousins. It was sheer excitement that morning!\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember I could not sleep the previous night thinking about the fun we would be having the next day. I got my picnic attire ready so that I would not have to waste any time the next day. I was the first to wake up and then called everybody so that we could start moving as soon as possible. Every minute seemed so precious. My mother got busy preparing some delicious breakfast and tasty snacks for the journey. My brother, cousins and myself were busy putting all the games together that we would be playing at our destination. But, where were going. Finally my father decided to take us to Nicco Park. This whole episode was so thrilling. Soon, we our entire family was seen scurrying into the car and 'hurray', we were on our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey by car was great. I had travelled by the 'Scorpio' many times, but today the drive down the road was different. The air was filled with fun and laughter and we were really enjoying ourselves. Mum's snacks were great and so was the fruit juice that we had while travelling. Along the way we cracked jokes and sand songs. We were soon in front of the gates of 'Nicco Park'. It was around 9:30 am in the morning. We got down from the car and we waited for my father and uncle who went to park the car and arrange for the entry tickets. The hurdle of booking the entry tickets was crossed easily and we were inside Nicco Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe managed to find a nice spot and settled down for a while. Then we started going for some of the most interesting rides. We began our endeavour by going on the merry-go-round. It was great fun. Then we hurried towards the counter for a ride named 'striking cars'. This ride was among the best because my father, mother, uncle, aunt and cousins all decided to go for the ride. We had a great time striking each other's car. The next ride we went on was the 'giant wheel'. This ride was scary but the next ride 'the roller coaster' brought my heart into my mouth. We were all sliding down from a great height to land into the water. I was screaming out of excitement when 'splash' I was thrown into water and so were my cousins. What a great feeling! My excitement surpassed my fear. There was no end to the rides. We went on the toy train that took us all around the park; we also went for a boat ride which so nice and enjoyable. Well by now it was lunch time!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father treated us to a great and sumptuous continental lunch that had some very tasty food on the platter. I enjoyed my lunch. After lunch we had ice-creams, which is my favourite. We rested for a while, and then started to play several games such as badminton, throw ball and frisbee. We also spent a good deal of time playing on slides, see-saws and swings. By then it was time for some nice coffee. My parents and relatives were busy chatting, while we helped ourselves with some great desserts. The desserts were just awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a little more time enjoying the cool breeze in the park and then decided to return home. We got into the car for our return journey back home. I was a bit sad as this beautiful day had come to an end. But, while returning home we could not stop talking about the fun we had.

      "text       We all love to go for picnics during our holidays, especially in the winter season. A picnic brings about excitement, exhilaration and breaks the monotony in our lives. I also had gone for a picnic with my family and relatives, the memories of which I will always cherish. We decided to go for a picnic on the 1st of march, which also coincided with the New Year celebrations. I remember how excited I was and so was my younger brother and cousins. It was sheer excitement that morning!\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember I could not sleep the previous night thinking about the fun we would be having the next day. I got my picnic attire ready so that I would not have to waste any time the next day. I was the first to wake up and then called everybody so that we could start moving as soon as possible. Every minute seemed so precious. My mother got busy preparing some delicious breakfast and tasty snacks for the journey. My brother, cousins and myself were busy putting all the games together that we would be playing at our destination. But, where were going. Finally my father decided to take us to Nicco Park. This whole episode was so thrilling. Soon, we our entire family was seen scurrying into the car and 'hurray', we were on our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey by car was great. I had travelled by the 'Scorpio' many times, but today the drive down the road was different. The air was filled with fun and laughter and we were really enjoying ourselves. Mum's snacks were great and so was the fruit juice that we had while travelling. Along the way we cracked jokes and sand songs. We were soon in front of the gates of 'Nicco Park'. It was around 9:30 am in the morning. We got down from the car and we waited for my father and uncle who went to park the car and arrange for the entry tickets. The hurdle of booking the entry tickets was crossed easily and we were inside Nicco Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe managed to find a nice spot and settled down for a while. Then we started going for some of the most interesting rides. We began our endeavour by going on the merry-go-round. It was great fun. Then we hurried towards the counter for a ride named 'striking cars'. This ride was among the best because my father, mother, uncle, aunt and cousins all decided to go for the ride. We had a great time striking each other's car. The next ride we went on was the 'giant wheel'. This ride was scary but the next ride 'the roller coaster' brought my heart into my mouth. We were all sliding down from a great height to land into the water. I was screaming out of excitement when 'splash' I was thrown into water and so were my cousins. What a great feeling! My excitement surpassed my fear. There was no end to the rides. We went on the toy train that took us all around the park; we also went for a boat ride which so nice and enjoyable. Well by now it was lunch time!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father treated us to a great and sumptuous continental lunch that had some very tasty food on the platter. I enjoyed my lunch. After lunch we had ice-creams, which is my favourite. We rested for a while, and then started to play several games such as badminton, throw ball and frisbee. We also spent a good deal of time playing on slides, see-saws and swings. By then it was time for some nice coffee. My parents and relatives were busy chatting, while we helped ourselves with some great desserts. The desserts were just awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a little more time enjoying the cool breeze in the park and then decided to return home. We got into the car for our return journey back home. I was a bit sad as this beautiful day had come to an end. But, while returning home we could not stop talking about the fun we had.

      "text       We all love to go for picnics during our holidays, especially in the winter season. A picnic brings about excitement, exhilaration and breaks the monotony in our lives. I also had gone for a picnic with my family and relatives, the memories of which I will always cherish. We decided to go for a picnic on the 1st of march, which also coincided with the New Year celebrations. I remember how excited I was and so was my younger brother and cousins. It was sheer excitement that morning!\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember I could not sleep the previous night thinking about the fun we would be having the next day. I got my picnic attire ready so that I would not have to waste any time the next day. I was the first to wake up and then called everybody so that we could start moving as soon as possible. Every minute seemed so precious. My mother got busy preparing some delicious breakfast and tasty snacks for the journey. My brother, cousins and myself were busy putting all the games together that we would be playing at our destination. But, where were going. Finally my father decided to take us to Nicco Park. This whole episode was so thrilling. Soon, we our entire family was seen scurrying into the car and 'hurray', we were on our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey by car was great. I had travelled by the 'Scorpio' many times, but today the drive down the road was different. The air was filled with fun and laughter and we were really enjoying ourselves. Mum's snacks were great and so was the fruit juice that we had while travelling. Along the way we cracked jokes and sand songs. We were soon in front of the gates of 'Nicco Park'. It was around 9:30 am in the morning. We got down from the car and we waited for my father and uncle who went to park the car and arrange for the entry tickets. The hurdle of booking the entry tickets was crossed easily and we were inside Nicco Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe managed to find a nice spot and settled down for a while. Then we started going for some of the most interesting rides. We began our endeavour by going on the merry-go-round. It was great fun. Then we hurried towards the counter for a ride named 'striking cars'. This ride was among the best because my father, mother, uncle, aunt and cousins all decided to go for the ride. We had a great time striking each other's car. The next ride we went on was the 'giant wheel'. This ride was scary but the next ride 'the roller coaster' brought my heart into my mouth. We were all sliding down from a great height to land into the water. I was screaming out of excitement when 'splash' I was thrown into water and so were my cousins. What a great feeling! My excitement surpassed my fear. There was no end to the rides. We went on the toy train that took us all around the park; we also went for a boat ride which so nice and enjoyable. Well by now it was lunch time!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father treated us to a great and sumptuous continental lunch that had some very tasty food on the platter. I enjoyed my lunch. After lunch we had ice-creams, which is my favourite. We rested for a while, and then started to play several games such as badminton, throw ball and frisbee. We also spent a good deal of time playing on slides, see-saws and swings. By then it was time for some nice coffee. My parents and relatives were busy chatting, while we helped ourselves with some great desserts. The desserts were just awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a little more time enjoying the cool breeze in the park and then decided to return home. We got into the car for our return journey back home. I was a bit sad as this beautiful day had come to an end. But, while returning home we could not stop talking about the fun we had.

      "text       We all love to go for picnics during our holidays, especially in the winter season. A picnic brings about excitement, exhilaration and breaks the monotony in our lives. I also had gone for a picnic with my family and relatives, the memories of which I will always cherish. We decided to go for a picnic on the 1st of march, which also coincided with the New Year celebrations. I remember how excited I was and so was my younger brother and cousins. It was sheer excitement that morning!\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember I could not sleep the previous night thinking about the fun we would be having the next day. I got my picnic attire ready so that I would not have to waste any time the next day. I was the first to wake up and then called everybody so that we could start moving as soon as possible. Every minute seemed so precious. My mother got busy preparing some delicious breakfast and tasty snacks for the journey. My brother, cousins and myself were busy putting all the games together that we would be playing at our destination. But, where were going. Finally my father decided to take us to Nicco Park. This whole episode was so thrilling. Soon, we our entire family was seen scurrying into the car and 'hurray', we were on our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey by car was great. I had travelled by the 'Scorpio' many times, but today the drive down the road was different. The air was filled with fun and laughter and we were really enjoying ourselves. Mum's snacks were great and so was the fruit juice that we had while travelling. Along the way we cracked jokes and sand songs. We were soon in front of the gates of 'Nicco Park'. It was around 9:30 am in the morning. We got down from the car and we waited for my father and uncle who went to park the car and arrange for the entry tickets. The hurdle of booking the entry tickets was crossed easily and we were inside Nicco Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe managed to find a nice spot and settled down for a while. Then we started going for some of the most interesting rides. We began our endeavour by going on the merry-go-round. It was great fun. Then we hurried towards the counter for a ride named 'striking cars'. This ride was among the best because my father, mother, uncle, aunt and cousins all decided to go for the ride. We had a great time striking each other's car. The next ride we went on was the 'giant wheel'. This ride was scary but the next ride 'the roller coaster' brought my heart into my mouth. We were all sliding down from a great height to land into the water. I was screaming out of excitement when 'splash' I was thrown into water and so were my cousins. What a great feeling! My excitement surpassed my fear. There was no end to the rides. We went on the toy train that took us all around the park; we also went for a boat ride which so nice and enjoyable. Well by now it was lunch time!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father treated us to a great and sumptuous continental lunch that had some very tasty food on the platter. I enjoyed my lunch. After lunch we had ice-creams, which is my favourite. We rested for a while, and then started to play several games such as badminton, throw ball and frisbee. We also spent a good deal of time playing on slides, see-saws and swings. By then it was time for some nice coffee. My parents and relatives were busy chatting, while we helped ourselves with some great desserts. The desserts were just awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a little more time enjoying the cool breeze in the park and then decided to return home. We got into the car for our return journey back home. I was a bit sad as this beautiful day had come to an end. But, while returning home we could not stop talking about the fun we had.

      "text       We all love to go for picnics during our holidays, especially in the winter season. A picnic brings about excitement, exhilaration and breaks the monotony in our lives. I also had gone for a picnic with my family and relatives, the memories of which I will always cherish. We decided to go for a picnic on the 1st of march, which also coincided with the New Year celebrations. I remember how excited I was and so was my younger brother and cousins. It was sheer excitement that morning!\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember I could not sleep the previous night thinking about the fun we would be having the next day. I got my picnic attire ready so that I would not have to waste any time the next day. I was the first to wake up and then called everybody so that we could start moving as soon as possible. Every minute seemed so precious. My mother got busy preparing some delicious breakfast and tasty snacks for the journey. My brother, cousins and myself were busy putting all the games together that we would be playing at our destination. But, where were going. Finally my father decided to take us to Nicco Park. This whole episode was so thrilling. Soon, we our entire family was seen scurrying into the car and 'hurray', we were on our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey by car was great. I had travelled by the 'Scorpio' many times, but today the drive down the road was different. The air was filled with fun and laughter and we were really enjoying ourselves. Mum's snacks were great and so was the fruit juice that we had while travelling. Along the way we cracked jokes and sand songs. We were soon in front of the gates of 'Nicco Park'. It was around 9:30 am in the morning. We got down from the car and we waited for my father and uncle who went to park the car and arrange for the entry tickets. The hurdle of booking the entry tickets was crossed easily and we were inside Nicco Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe managed to find a nice spot and settled down for a while. Then we started going for some of the most interesting rides. We began our endeavour by going on the merry-go-round. It was great fun. Then we hurried towards the counter for a ride named 'striking cars'. This ride was among the best because my father, mother, uncle, aunt and cousins all decided to go for the ride. We had a great time striking each other's car. The next ride we went on was the 'giant wheel'. This ride was scary but the next ride 'the roller coaster' brought my heart into my mouth. We were all sliding down from a great height to land into the water. I was screaming out of excitement when 'splash' I was thrown into water and so were my cousins. What a great feeling! My excitement surpassed my fear. There was no end to the rides. We went on the toy train that took us all around the park; we also went for a boat ride which so nice and enjoyable. Well by now it was lunch time!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father treated us to a great and sumptuous continental lunch that had some very tasty food on the platter. I enjoyed my lunch. After lunch we had ice-creams, which is my favourite. We rested for a while, and then started to play several games such as badminton, throw ball and frisbee. We also spent a good deal of time playing on slides, see-saws and swings. By then it was time for some nice coffee. My parents and relatives were busy chatting, while we helped ourselves with some great desserts. The desserts were just awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a little more time enjoying the cool breeze in the park and then decided to return home. We got into the car for our return journey back home. I was a bit sad as this beautiful day had come to an end. But, while returning home we could not stop talking about the fun we had.

      "text       We all love to go for picnics during our holidays, especially in the winter season. A picnic brings about excitement, exhilaration and breaks the monotony in our lives. I also had gone for a picnic with my family and relatives, the memories of which I will always cherish. We decided to go for a picnic on the 1st of march, which also coincided with the New Year celebrations. I remember how excited I was and so was my younger brother and cousins. It was sheer excitement that morning!\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember I could not sleep the previous night thinking about the fun we would be having the next day. I got my picnic attire ready so that I would not have to waste any time the next day. I was the first to wake up and then called everybody so that we could start moving as soon as possible. Every minute seemed so precious. My mother got busy preparing some delicious breakfast and tasty snacks for the journey. My brother, cousins and myself were busy putting all the games together that we would be playing at our destination. But, where were going. Finally my father decided to take us to Nicco Park. This whole episode was so thrilling. Soon, we our entire family was seen scurrying into the car and 'hurray', we were on our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey by car was great. I had travelled by the 'Scorpio' many times, but today the drive down the road was different. The air was filled with fun and laughter and we were really enjoying ourselves. Mum's snacks were great and so was the fruit juice that we had while travelling. Along the way we cracked jokes and sand songs. We were soon in front of the gates of 'Nicco Park'. It was around 9:30 am in the morning. We got down from the car and we waited for my father and uncle who went to park the car and arrange for the entry tickets. The hurdle of booking the entry tickets was crossed easily and we were inside Nicco Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe managed to find a nice spot and settled down for a while. Then we started going for some of the most interesting rides. We began our endeavour by going on the merry-go-round. It was great fun. Then we hurried towards the counter for a ride named 'striking cars'. This ride was among the best because my father, mother, uncle, aunt and cousins all decided to go for the ride. We had a great time striking each other's car. The next ride we went on was the 'giant wheel'. This ride was scary but the next ride 'the roller coaster' brought my heart into my mouth. We were all sliding down from a great height to land into the water. I was screaming out of excitement when 'splash' I was thrown into water and so were my cousins. What a great feeling! My excitement surpassed my fear. There was no end to the rides. We went on the toy train that took us all around the park; we also went for a boat ride which so nice and enjoyable. Well by now it was lunch time!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father treated us to a great and sumptuous continental lunch that had some very tasty food on the platter. I enjoyed my lunch. After lunch we had ice-creams, which is my favourite. We rested for a while, and then started to play several games such as badminton, throw ball and frisbee. We also spent a good deal of time playing on slides, see-saws and swings. By then it was time for some nice coffee. My parents and relatives were busy chatting, while we helped ourselves with some great desserts. The desserts were just awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a little more time enjoying the cool breeze in the park and then decided to return home. We got into the car for our return journey back home. I was a bit sad as this beautiful day had come to an end. But, while returning home we could not stop talking about the fun we had.

      "text       We all love to go for picnics during our holidays, especially in the winter season. A picnic brings about excitement, exhilaration and breaks the monotony in our lives. I also had gone for a picnic with my family and relatives, the memories of which I will always cherish. We decided to go for a picnic on the 1st of march, which also coincided with the New Year celebrations. I remember how excited I was and so was my younger brother and cousins. It was sheer excitement that morning!\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember I could not sleep the previous night thinking about the fun we would be having the next day. I got my picnic attire ready so that I would not have to waste any time the next day. I was the first to wake up and then called everybody so that we could start moving as soon as possible. Every minute seemed so precious. My mother got busy preparing some delicious breakfast and tasty snacks for the journey. My brother, cousins and myself were busy putting all the games together that we would be playing at our destination. But, where were going. Finally my father decided to take us to Nicco Park. This whole episode was so thrilling. Soon, we our entire family was seen scurrying into the car and 'hurray', we were on our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey by car was great. I had travelled by the 'Scorpio' many times, but today the drive down the road was different. The air was filled with fun and laughter and we were really enjoying ourselves. Mum's snacks were great and so was the fruit juice that we had while travelling. Along the way we cracked jokes and sand songs. We were soon in front of the gates of 'Nicco Park'. It was around 9:30 am in the morning. We got down from the car and we waited for my father and uncle who went to park the car and arrange for the entry tickets. The hurdle of booking the entry tickets was crossed easily and we were inside Nicco Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe managed to find a nice spot and settled down for a while. Then we started going for some of the most interesting rides. We began our endeavour by going on the merry-go-round. It was great fun. Then we hurried towards the counter for a ride named 'striking cars'. This ride was among the best because my father, mother, uncle, aunt and cousins all decided to go for the ride. We had a great time striking each other's car. The next ride we went on was the 'giant wheel'. This ride was scary but the next ride 'the roller coaster' brought my heart into my mouth. We were all sliding down from a great height to land into the water. I was screaming out of excitement when 'splash' I was thrown into water and so were my cousins. What a great feeling! My excitement surpassed my fear. There was no end to the rides. We went on the toy train that took us all around the park; we also went for a boat ride which so nice and enjoyable. Well by now it was lunch time!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father treated us to a great and sumptuous continental lunch that had some very tasty food on the platter. I enjoyed my lunch. After lunch we had ice-creams, which is my favourite. We rested for a while, and then started to play several games such as badminton, throw ball and frisbee. We also spent a good deal of time playing on slides, see-saws and swings. By then it was time for some nice coffee. My parents and relatives were busy chatting, while we helped ourselves with some great desserts. The desserts were just awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a little more time enjoying the cool breeze in the park and then decided to return home. We got into the car for our return journey back home. I was a bit sad as this beautiful day had come to an end. But, while returning home we could not stop talking about the fun we had. Most of all we were busy browsing through some of the nicest photographs taken by my mother and aunt. Some nice video recordings were also taken. It was a wonderful picnic that we all thoroughly enjoyed, the memories of which will always be cherished from the bottom of my heart.. - See more at: \n",

      "text       Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.\\r\\n\\r\\nIave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.\\r\\nShe was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?\\r\\n\\r\\nIam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly cow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.\n",

      "text       Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.\\r\\n\\r\\nIave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.\\r\\nShe was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?\\r\\n\\r\\nIam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly cow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.\n",

      "text       Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.\\r\\n\\r\\nIave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.\\r\\nShe was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?\\r\\n\\r\\nIam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly cow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.\n",

      "text       Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.\\r\\n\\r\\nIave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.\\r\\nShe was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?\\r\\n\\r\\nIam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly cow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.\n",

      "text       On a holiday, I was sitting in my room after finishing my home work. As my friends were away to hill stations, I was feeling very lonely. I watched the cars and other vehicles passing by and wished that like my friends, I would also have been travelling or passing my time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile my mind was occupied with thoughts of holidays and having fun with my friends, the door bell rang. I ran to answer it and found the postman with a parcel and a letter for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI signed the paper and took the parcel. My hands were itching to open the packet as my curiosity knew no bounds. I ripped the parcel open and found a beautiful tape recorder in it. The parcel had been sent from the United States and the letter along with it was from my uncle who had sent me that wonderful gift.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, even more joy than receiving the tape recorder was the letter which my uncle had written. The letter was an invitation to go to the United States for my holidays. My uncle had arranged everything for me-the tickets and the visa, and I already had a passport.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart skipped several beats as I ran to give this great news to my mother. She was taken aback initially and her first reaction was not so positive.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, she thought about it, consulted my father who was at his office and they both agreed to allow me to go to the United States to spend the rest of my holidays with my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI jumped from room to room and started packing my clothes, my toys, my books and other articles that I would need on the flight and in America. My mind was filled with various ideas about how I would spend my time with my cousins. I started dreaming about Disney world, Universal studios, the Statue of Liberty, the Grand Canyon and all the other tourist attractions that I had read about in magazines.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father took me shopping the same day because he felt that I would need some more things to take with me. We bought gifts for my cousins and my uncle and aunt and when I came back home my cupboard was full of new clothes, shoes, gifts, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I had not expected any such thing to happen to me, and I had been feeling sorry for myself, this offer came as a great surprise. This was indeed the happiest day of my life and I don't think I shall ever forget it as long as I live.\n",

      "text       This day marked one of the biggest honorable achievements of my life. Towards the end of my senior year of high school, Lawrence Upper Campus holds a convocation ceremony the day before commencement. It is an event that awards every student for their achievements academically and inspirationally. One of the biggest awards that they hand out is known as the Joshua Dawson Memorial Award. Joshua was a student a grade above me who died, along with his mother, in a terrible car accident in 2011. I never knew Joshua personally.God bless the Dawson family, and may Joshua's spirit continue to spread happiness to all\n",

      "text       What an incredible opportunity this was! This was before I started getting into 80's music, which may be a reason why I now love it! Or my father made me listen to it in the car, so I finally got used to it ... But anyways, this really was an amazing experience. During our senior year, my best friend Sarah got the opportunity to volunteer at the Induction Ceremony in Cleveland because she was a volunteer intern at the Rock Hall of Fame.but it was extremely cool! \n",

      "text       I like traveling. I'm very thankful to god because giving me a family that loves to travel. When I go for traveling with my family, there are a lot of interesting place that we visit. Between traveling at bigger city and go traveling at Island, I will choose the Island to travel. I don't like travel at bigger city because it was so noisy and a lot of pollution. Enough for me to live and always trapped in the traffic jam especially when I'm go back home to my own town Johor Bharu. My parent will take us to go for traveling especially when school holiday is coming. A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven o'clock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o'clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. I'm the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort. Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island. \\r\\n\\r\\n\n",

      "text       I like traveling. I'm very thankful to god because giving me a family that loves to travel. When I go for traveling with my family, there are a lot of interesting place that we visit. Between traveling at bigger city and go traveling at Island, I will choose the Island to travel. I don't like travel at bigger city because it was so noisy and a lot of pollution. Enough for me to live and always trapped in the traffic jam especially when I'm go back home to my own town Johor Bharu. My parent will take us to go for traveling especially when school holiday is coming. A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven o'clock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o'clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. I'm the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort.

      "text       Summer vacation. It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We reached Mettupalayam by train. From there we took another train for Wellington. This journey, in the little mountain railway, was quite exhilarating and unforgettable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the journey we saw breath-taking scenes of Nigeria hills and forests. There were my maternal uncle, aunt, their little daughter Jasmine and 2 attendants to receive us at the station. We were overjoyed to see and meet one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day, and then on the week-end, we visited Ooty. On both these visits we enjoyed the beauty, freshness, food walking, horse-riding and excursions. Situated at the height of 2,286 meters on Nigeria hills, Ooty is a very popular and famous hill resort of South India. It is in the state of Tamil Nadu. Full of rich tourist- activities and possibilities round the year, Ooty was discovered in 1819 by the then collector of Combater, an Englishman, Mr. John Sullivan. He constructed his summer residence there. He was the first man to do so. He was soon followed by numerous other Englishmen. It then became the summer seat of Provincial Government of Madras.\\r\\nThe temperate coolness attracts a large crowd of people from nearby areas, provinces and distant parts of the country. Originally it belonged to the Toads, a hill tribe which still lives in the Nigeria Hills. This \"Queen of the Hill Stations\" is full of nice outdoor activities like hiking, boating, fishing, horse-riding, long walks, excursions and shopping. There is a big and wonderful botanical garden in the very heart of the town. It has more than 600 varieties of exotic plants and trees. We visited the botanical garden and then enjoyed boating in the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to Deadbeats Peak in our uncle's car. From there we had an excellent panoramic view of the plains below. Is the highest point and boasts the height of 2,638 meters. There is also a telescope for the viewing pleasure of the tourists. We also visited and immensely enjoyed the nearby Sam's Park, a nice picnic spot full of many varieties of plants, trees, herbs and a fine pool full of lilies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopping in the small but colorful market of the town is an unforgettable experience. Mother bought a few silk saris', spices and some other items as gifts for our friends and relations. I bought some special tea and items of woodcraft. Ooty, overlooking blue hills and lush green valleys, is a very pleasant place and tourist resort. There was a big crowd of Indian and foreign tourists.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also visited nearby Connor, a small but colorful town amidst sprawling tea gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this still station. We also exposed a number of films to capture beautiful and natural scenes, events and memorable moments. These photographs will help us to keep our joy and memories of the place ever new and fresh.\n",
